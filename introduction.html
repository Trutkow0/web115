                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Personal Background:</strong> I grew up in Charlotte, I’m a musician, and an avid pro wrestling fan.</li>
                    <li><strong>Professional Background:</strong> I’ve worked in an After School Program with CMS for 8 years and as an Assistant Rural Carrier for the USPS for 4 years. </li> 
                    <li><strong>Academic Background:</strong> I’ve completed the AFA - Music degree program at CPCC as well as an Audio Engineering certificate program. After discovering a passion and talent for Web Development I decided to pursue an IT degree in Full Stack Programming.</li> 
                    <li><strong>Background in this Subject:</strong> I started learning HTML and CSS using LinkedIn Learning courses and practicing by developing my own website hosted on a Linode server. From there I decided I wanted to receive more training and experience in this subject to pursue it as a career and enrolled in the CPCC Full Stack Programming degree. I’ve learned how to develop projects using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and mySQL. </li> 
                    <li><strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong> Laptop/Linux Mint</li> 
                    <li><strong>Courses I'm Taking &amp; Why:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong><a href="contract.html">WEB115 - Web Markup &amp; Scripting:</a></strong> I’m looking to expand my knowledge in Web Development and enhance my skills to build more dynamic and interactive projects.</li>
                            <li><strong>WEB140 - Web Development Tools:</strong> This course will help me to become familiar with common tools used in the industry as well as provide me with tools that can enhance my personal and professional projects.</li> 
                        </ul>
                    </li> 
                    <li><strong>Funny/Interesting Item to Remember me by:</strong> Trying to remember the name “Domingo”, I mispronounced it and said “Dominigo”. I then went on to make a madlibs and only use "Dominigo" to fill in all the spaces. It was so iconic that it is now my brother’s nickname for me.</li>
