                <h2>Course Contract</h2>
                <p>I, <a href="introduction.html">Timothy E. Rutkowski</a>, agree to abide by the terms in my Fall 2024 WEB115-N801: Web Markup &amp; Scripting Course with my instructor, D.I. von Briesen.</p>
                <p>I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal websites will be publicly available to the world. I will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.</p>
                <p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>
                <p>Signed: <i>Timothy E. Rutkowski, 14 August 2024</i></p>
