Greens and browns were selected to represent nature and grounding, establishing a strong, earthy foundation for the Tenacious Raccoon brand. These colors create a base that is both stable and nurturing, reflecting the natural world and the raccoon's connection to it.

                Dark brown is used for emphasized areas such as the navigation bar and headings. This color is grounded, bold, and determined, but it maintains a quiet strength, avoiding the need to be overly loud or brash. Finally, rustic orange is chosen to accent key features, adding a pop of color that injects energy and creativity into the design. This warm, vibrant hue contrasts beautifully with the more subdued tones, symbolizing innovation and the spark of creativity that drives the Tenacious Raccoon brand.</p>
